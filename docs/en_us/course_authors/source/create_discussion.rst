Overview
*******************

You can add a Discussion component to a Unit, to pose a question related to the Unit and give students a chance to respond and interact.

See the following topics:

* :ref:`Create a Discussion Component`
* :ref:`A Student's View of the Discussion`


Before you add a Discussion component, it is generally a good idea to add an HTML component that 
introduces the topic to be discussed. The Discussion component itself does not contain any text and may be easy for students to overlook.

.. note:: Before you create a Discussion component, consider that Discussion categories are immediately visible in your forum (on the Discussion tab for your course) when you create them, even though the unit that contains the Discussion component is set to Private.


To create a new HTML component in an existing Unit, ensure the Unit is Private.  
For more information on Public and Private Units, see LINK.

#. Under **Add New Component**, click the **discussion** icon.

.. _A Student's View of the Discussion:

A Student's View of the Discussion

For students, Discussion component names appear in the course ribbon at the top of the page:

The Discussion space appears under other components in the unit. 
It doesn't have a label in the body of the unit. 
Instead, students see "Show discussion" or "Hide discussion" on the left, 
and a blue **New Post** button on the right.

In the following example, the Discussion component follows Video and HTML components:

In the **Discussion** tab at the top of the page, 
students can find the category and subcategory of the discussion in the left pane.
