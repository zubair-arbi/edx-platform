---------- end split mongo backend section ---------

Blades: Hovering over CC button in video player, when transcripts are hidden,
will cause them to show up. Moving the mouse from the CC button will auto hide
them. You can hover over the CC button and then move the mouse to the

improvements, fixes, and internationalization to the Student Info section.

new post dropdown as well as response and comment area labeling.

assessors to edit the original submitter's work.

LMS: Fixed a bug that caused links from forum user profile pages to
threads to lead to 404s if the course id contained a '-' character.

Studio/LMS: Added ability to set due date formatting through Studio's Advanced
Settings.  The key is due_date_display_format, and the value should be a format
supported by Python's strftime function.

Common: Added configurable backends for tracking events. Tracking events using
the python logging module is the default backend. Support for MongoDB and a
Django database is also available.

answer from '1/3' to 'sqrt(12)*(1-1/3^2+1/5/3^2)' are valid.

Studio/LMS: Allow for 'preview' and 'published' in a single LMS instance. Use
middlware components to retain the incoming Django request and put in thread
local storage. It is recommended that all developers define a 'preview.localhost'
which maps to the same IP address as localhost in his/her HOSTS file.

LMS: Enable beta instructor dashboard. The beta dashboard is a rearchitecture
of the existing instructor dashboard and is available by clicking a link at
the top right of the existing dashboard.

Common: CourseEnrollment has new fields `is_active` and `mode`. The mode will be
used to differentiate different kinds of enrollments (currently, all enrollments
are honor certificate enrollments). The `is_active` flag will be used to
deactivate enrollments without deleting them, so that we know what course you
*were* enrolled in. Because of the latter change, enrollment and unenrollment
logic has been consolidated into the model -- you should use new class methods
to `enroll()`, `unenroll()`, and to check `is_enrolled()`, instead of creating
CourseEnrollment objects or querying them directly.

LMS: Added bulk email for course feature, with option to optout of individual
course emails.

Studio: Email will be sent to admin address when a user requests course creator
privileges for Studio (edge only).

Studio: Studio course authors (both instructors and staff) will be auto-enrolled
for their courses so that "View Live" works.

student's input.

text, and fourth field for course run.

Blades: New features for VideoAlpha player:
1.) Controls are auto hidden after a delay of mouse inactivity - the full video
becomes visible.

a delay of mouse inactivity). The video player size does not change - the video
is down-sized and placed in the middle of the black area.
3.) All source code of Video Alpha 2 is written in JavaScript. It is not a basic
conversion from CoffeeScript. The structure of the player has been changed.
4.) A lot of additional unit tests.

LMS: Added user preferences (arbitrary user/key/value tuples, for which
which user/key is unique) and a REST API for reading users and
preferences. Access to the REST API is restricted by use of the
X-Edx-Api-Key HTTP header (which must match settings.EDX_API_KEY; if
the setting is not present, the API is disabled).

LMS: Added endpoints for AJAX requests to enable/disable notifications
(which are not yet implemented) and a one-click unsubscribe page.

Studio: Allow instructors of a course to designate other staff as instructors;
this allows instructors to hand off management of a course to someone else.

projects

as wide as the text to reduce accidental choice selections.

Studio:
- use xblock field defaults to initialize all new instances' fields and
  only use templates as override samples.
- create new instances via in memory create_xmodule and related methods rather
  than cloning a db record.
- have an explicit method for making a draft copy as distinct from making a
  new module.

Studio: Remove XML from the video component editor. All settings are
moved to be edited as metadata.

XModule: Only write out assets files if the contents have changed.

Studio: Course settings are now saved explicitly.

instance, when XModule provides a coffeescript file, don't delete
the associated javascript)

Studio: For courses running on edx.org (marketing site), disable fields in
Course Settings that do not apply.

Common: Make asset watchers run as singletons (so they won't start if the
watcher is already running in another shell).

Common: Use coffee directly when watching for coffeescript file changes.

Common: Make rake provide better error messages if packages are missing.

Common: Repairs development documentation generation by sphinx.

LMS: Problem rescoring.  Added options on the Grades tab of the
Instructor Dashboard to allow all students' submissions for a
particular problem to be rescored.  Also supports resetting all
students' number of attempts to zero.  Provides a list of background
tasks that are currently running for the course, and an option to
see a history of background tasks for a given problem.

LMS: Fixed the preferences scope for storing data in xmodules.

LMS: Forums.  Added handling for case where discussion module can get `None` as
value of lms.start in `lms/djangoapps/django_comment_client/utils.py`

Studio, LMS: Make ModelTypes more strict about their expected content (for
instance, Boolean, Integer, String), but also allow them to hold either the
typed value, or a String that can be converted to their typed value. For
example, an Integer can contain 3 or '3'. This changed an update to the xblock
library.

setting now run entirely outside the Python sandbox.

show/hide captions.

are logged on the server (in the logs).

create or use struct_times nor naive datetimes.

Common: Developers can now have private Django settings files.

Common: Safety code added to prevent anything above the vertical level in the
course tree from being marked as version='draft'. It will raise an exception if
the code tries to so mark a node. We need the backtraces to figure out where
this very infrequent intermittent marking was occurring. It was making courses
look different in Studio than in LMS.

Deploy: MKTG_URLS is now read from env.json.
