Feature: CMS.Transcripts
  As a course author, I want to be able to create video components.

    # For transcripts acceptance tests there are 3 available caption
    # files. They can be used to test various transcripts features. Two of
    # them can be imported from YouTube.
    #
    # The length of each file name is 11 characters. This is because the
    # YouTube's ID length is 11 characters. If file name is not of length 11,
    # front-end validation will not pass.
    #
    #     t__eq_exist - this file exists on YouTube, and can be imported
    #                   via the transcripts menu; after import, this file will
    #                   be equal to the one stored locally
    #     t_neq_exist - same as above, except local file will differ from the
    #                   one stored on YouTube
    #     t_not_exist - this file does not exist on YouTube; it exists locally

        And I enter a "456.webm" source to field number 2
        Then I see error message "file_type"
        # Currently we are working with 2nd field. It means, that if 2nd field
        # contain incorrect value, 1st and 3rd fields should be disabled until
        # 2nd field will be filled by correct correct value
        And I expect 1, 3 inputs are disabled
        When I clear fields
        And I expect inputs are enabled

        #User input URL with incorrect format
        And I enter a "htt://link.c" source to field number 1

        # We are not clearing fields here,
        # Because we changing same field.
